# Virtual-Mouse
Initially, the hand gesture images are captured from the vision-based camera.  The project covers as a hand recognition tool which could be used to move the mouse pointer, perform simple operations like clicking and other hand gesture operations like moving file from computer to computer through delicate socket programming and performing simple but fascinating operations that could be covered with the hand recognition Experimental setup of the system uses fixed position low-cost web camera high definition recording feature mounted on the top of monitor of computer or a fixed camera on a laptop, which captures snapshot using Red Green Blue [RGB] color space from fixed distance. A virtual mouse is a device used to air-browse the functions of a system such as a computer, laptop or a smart-pad with the functions corresponding to a mouse and a marker. It can be used in class-rooms for teaching without the board and chalk. This can also be used in conferences as a smart device to work as a mouse. A person is just required to make the corresponding gestures imitating a mouse or a marker in front of an Infra-red (IR) camera using this hardware device which is modeled as a pen and this avoids the use of wired mouse, chalks and boards.
